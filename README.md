## General Info
Sometimes, you feel demotivated and think you can't get through everything in life. Some other times, you may want to give up learning a course that seems to be in a dead end. Well, Multiple Quotes Generator is here to help you think better about life!

This is a multiple quotes generator made for a personal portfolio from Codecademy's course in Full Stack Development Learning Path (thanks Codecademy!). Every time you run it, you'll get three different quotes on 3 different aspects in life: gym or fitness, heartbreak, and learning, made personally for you! The outputs are randomised, therefore different runs will generate different quotes.

## How to Run
1. Download this file and preferably put this folder in C:\Users\*Computer Name*\.
2. Download Notepad++ here (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) if you don't want to download VS Code.
3. Open script.js and edit line 26 with your own name.
4. Install Node here (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Skip to number 4 if you have done so before.
5. Make sure Node is already added in environment path on your desktop.
6. Use your Windows Search and open Node.js command prompt.
7. If you put the folder in the right directory, just type cd multiple-quotes-generator in the command prompt.
8. Now run node script.js. The prompt should show the personalised message for you!

## Future Improvements
1. Integration with HTML and CSS to make it in an interactive website.
2. Adding more quotes and aspects.
3. Please let me know if you have any other advices.
